	abstract = {The Earth' s gravity field change caused by the inner core' s super rotation is investigated. It is dissertated that the inner core has three main characters: it has ellipsoidal shape; the anisotropic symmetric axis of the inner core coincides with its self-rotation axis; the rotation axis of the inner core is tilted to and processes around the Earth's rotation axis. The inner core' s super rotation gives rise to the mass redistribution of the Earth system, and consequently results in the variation of the gravity field. By investigating the motion of the inner core's super rotation, a model of gravity change caused by the inner core's super rotation is established. Calculation results are provided about the gravity variations on the whole surface of the Earth caused by the inner core' s super rotation. Under the assumption of the super rotation rate V/a, the maximum gravity variation in one year is around 0.37 micro Gal.},

@article{RN15,
	abstract = {We analyze 2006\#8211;2009 data from four continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers located between 5 and 150 km from the glacier Jakobshavn Isbr{\^E}, West Greenland. The GPS stations were established on bedrock to determine the vertical crustal motion due to the unloading of ice from Jakobshavn Isbr{\^E}. All stations experienced uplift, but the uplift rate at Kangia North, only 5 km from the glacier front, was about 10 mm yr\#8722;1 larger than the rate at Ilulissat, located only \#8764;45 km further away. This suggests that most of the uplift is due to the unloading of the Earth's surface as Jakobshavn thins and loses mass. Our estimate of Jakobshavn's contribution to uplift rates at Kangia North and Ilulissat are 14.6 $\pm$1.7 mm yr\#8722;1 and 4.9 $\pm$1.1 mm yr\#8722;1, respectively. The observed rates are consistent with a glacier thinning model based on repeat altimeter surveys from NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), which shows that Jakobshavn lost mass at an average rate of 22 $\pm$2 km3 yr\#8722;1 between 2006 and 2009. At Kangia North and Ilulissat, the predicted uplift rates computed using thinning estimates from the ATM laser altimetry are 12.1 $\pm$0.9 mm yr\#8722;1 and 3.2 $\pm$0.3 mm yr\#8722;1, respectively. The observed rates are slightly larger than the predicted rates. The fact that the GPS uplift rates are much larger closer to Jakobshavn than further away, and are consistent with rates inferred using the ATM-based glacier thinning model, shows that GPS measurements of crustal motion are a potentially useful method for assessing ice-mass change models.},

@article{RN26,
	abstract = {Ground-based measurements of active layer thickness provide useful data for validating/calibrating remote sensing and modeling results. However, these in situ measurements are usually site-specific with limited spatial coverage. Here we apply interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to measure surface deformation over permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska during the 1992-2000 thawing seasons. We find significantly systematic differences in surface deformation between floodplain areas and the tundra-covered areas away from the rivers. Using floodplain areas as the reference for InSAR's relative deformation measurements, we find seasonally varying vertical displacements of 1-4 cm with subsidence occurring during the thawing season and a secular subsidence of 1-4 cm/decade. We hypothesize that the seasonal subsidence is caused by thaw settlement of the active layer and that the secular subsidence is probably due to thawing of ice-rich permafrost near the permafrost table. These mechanisms could explain why in situ measurements on Alaskan North Slope reveal negligible trends in active layer thickness during the 1990s, despite the fact that atmospheric and permafrost temperatures in this region increased during that time. This study demonstrates that surface deformation measurements from InSAR are complementary to more traditional in situ measurements of active layer thickness, and can provide new insights into the dynamics of permafrost systems and changes in permafrost conditions.},

	abstract = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
