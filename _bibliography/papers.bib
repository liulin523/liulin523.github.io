	abstract = {Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs), formed by abrupt degradation of ice-rich permafrost, are widely distributed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, causing infrastructure damage and enhancing soil carbon emissions. We compiled annual RTS inventories across the plateau from 2016 to 2022 using a deep-learning-aided method to quantify the spatial-temporal variations. We found that RTS-affected locations increased from 1,592 to 3,805 in 2016--2022, which increased affected areas by 2.8 times from 1,714 to 6,507 ha. The most active initiation and expansion periods were in 2016--2017 and 2018--2019. RTSs tend to be clustered, showing local heterogeneity among clusters characterized by various responses toward high temperatures and precipitation and tendencies to be on different topography and vegetation types. This research reveals the rapid development, wide distribution and regional heterogeneity of RTS activities, serving as a crucial step toward understanding how RTSs respond to climate change and regional environmental varieties.},

	abstract = {A talik is a layer or body of unfrozen ground that occurs in permafrost due to an anomaly in thermal, hydrological, or hydrochemical conditions. Information about talik geometry is important for understanding regional surface water and groundwater interactions as well as sublacustrine methane production in thermokarst lakes. Due to the direct measurement of unfrozen water content, surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a promising geophysical method for noninvasively estimating talik dimensions. We made surface NMR measurements on thermokarst lakes and terrestrial permafrost near Fairbanks, Alaska, and confirmed our results using limited direct measurements. At an 8 m deep lake, we observed thaw bulb at least 22 m below the surface; at a 1.4 m deep lake, we detected a talik extending between 5 and 6 m below the surface. Our study demonstrates the value that surface NMR may have in the cryosphere for studies of thermokarst lake hydrology and their related role in the carbon cycle.},

@article{wahr2013,
	abstract = {We describe how GPS measurements of horizontal crustal motion can be used to augment vertical crustal motion measurements, to improve and extend GPS studies of surface loading. We show that the ratio of the vertical displacement to the horizontal displacement, combined with the direction of the horizontal motion, can help determine whether nearby loading is concentrated in a small region (for example, in a single lake or glacier), and where that region is. We illustrate this method by applying it to two specific cases: an analysis of GPS data from northern California to monitor the level of Lake Shasta, and the analysis of data from a single GPS site in southeast Greenland to determine mass variability of two large, nearby outlet glaciers: Helheim Glacier and Midgaard Glacier. The California example serves largely as a proof-of-concept, where the results can be assessed by comparing with independent observations (Lake Shasta tide gauge data, in this case). Our Greenland results show that both Helheim and Midgaard have experienced notable interannual variations in mass loss rate over the last decade. Helheim's mass loss accelerated rapidly in mid-2003, decelerated in late 2005, and increased again in 2008--2009 before returning to about its pre-2003 rate in late 2010. Midgaard's mass loss accelerated in mid-2004, and remained more-or-less constant before returning to its pre-2003 rate in late 2008.},

Horizontal displacements during 2006--2010 at KAGA, ILUL, and QEQE, relative to the site AASI, are directed toward north-west, suggesting that the main mass loss signal is located near the frontal portion of JI. The directions of the observed displacements are supported by modeled displacements, derived from NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) surveys of surface elevations from 2006, 2009, and 2010. However, horizontal displacements during 2010--2012 at KAGA and ILUL are directed more towards the west suggesting a change in the spatial distribution of the ice mass loss. In addition, we observe an increase in the uplift rate during 2010--2012 as compared to 2006--2010. The sudden change in vertical and horizontal displacements is due to enhanced melt-induced ice loss in 2010 and 2012.},

@article{liualt,
	abstract = {The measurement of temporal changes in active layer thickness (ALT) is crucial to monitoring permafrost degradation in the Arctic. We develop a retrieval algorithm to estimate long-term average ALT using thaw-season surface subsidence derived from spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. Our algorithm uses a model of vertical distribution of water content within the active layer accounting for soil texture, organic matter, and moisture. We determine the 1992-2000 average ALT for an 80 x 100 km study area of continuous permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska near Prudhoe Bay. We obtain an ALT of 30-50 cm over moist tundra areas, and a larger ALT of 50-80 cm over wet tundra areas. Our estimated ALT values match in situ measurements at Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) sites within uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that InSAR can provide ALT estimates over large areas at high spatial resolution.},

@article{liu2010,
	abstract = {Ground-based measurements of active layer thickness provide useful data for validating/calibrating remote sensing and modeling results. However, these in situ measurements are usually site-specific with limited spatial coverage. Here we apply interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to measure surface deformation over permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska during the 1992-2000 thawing seasons. We find significantly systematic differences in surface deformation between floodplain areas and the tundra-covered areas away from the rivers. Using floodplain areas as the reference for InSAR's relative deformation measurements, we find seasonally varying vertical displacements of 1-4 cm with subsidence occurring during the thawing season and a secular subsidence of 1-4 cm/decade. We hypothesize that the seasonal subsidence is caused by thaw settlement of the active layer and that the secular subsidence is probably due to thawing of ice-rich permafrost near the permafrost table. These mechanisms could explain why in situ measurements on Alaskan North Slope reveal negligible trends in active layer thickness during the 1990s, despite the fact that atmospheric and permafrost temperatures in this region increased during that time. This study demonstrates that surface deformation measurements from InSAR are complementary to more traditional in situ measurements of active layer thickness, and can provide new insights into the dynamics of permafrost systems and changes in permafrost conditions.},

@article{liu2012,
	abstract = {Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} in west Greenland has been undergoing dramatic thinning since 1997. Applying the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to Radarsat-1 SAR data, we measure crustal uplift near Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} caused by recent ice mass loss. The crustal uplift is predominantly at long spatial wavelengths (larger than 10 km), and thus is difficult to separate from InSAR orbit errors. We reduce the effects of orbit errors by removing long-wavelength deformation signals using conventional InSAR baseline fitting methods. We find good agreement between the remaining short-scale InSAR-estimated deformation rates during 2004-2008 and the corresponding short-scale components of a deformation model that is based on changes in ice elevation measured by NASA′s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). We are also able to use the InSAR-measured deformation to invert for the spatial pattern of ice thinning. Overall, our results suggest that despite the inherent difficulties of working with a signal that has significant large-scale components, InSAR-measured crustal deformation can be used to study the ice mass loss of a rapidly thinning glacier and its surrounding catchment, providing both a constraint on any existing model of ice mass loss and a data source that can be used to invert for ice mass loss. These new applications of InSAR can help to better understand a glacier′s rapid response to a warming climate.},

@article{khan2010,
	abstract = {We analyze 2006--2009 data from four continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers located between 5 and 150 km from the glacier Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}, West Greenland. The GPS stations were established on bedrock to determine the vertical crustal motion due to the unloading of ice from Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}. All stations experienced uplift, but the uplift rate at Kangia North, only 5 km from the glacier front, was about 10 mm yr−1 larger than the rate at Ilulissat, located only ∼45 km further away. This suggests that most of the uplift is due to the unloading of the Earth's surface as Jakobshavn thins and loses mass. Our estimate of Jakobshavn's contribution to uplift rates at Kangia North and Ilulissat are 14.6 $\pm$ 1.7 mm yr−1 and 4.9 $\pm$ 1.1 mm yr−1, respectively. The observed rates are consistent with a glacier thinning model based on repeat altimeter surveys from NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), which shows that Jakobshavn lost mass at an average rate of 22 $\pm$ 2 km3 yr−1 between 2006 and 2009. At Kangia North and Ilulissat, the predicted uplift rates computed using thinning estimates from the ATM laser altimetry are 12.1 $\pm$ 0.9 mm yr−1 and 3.2 $\pm$ 0.3 mm yr−1, respectively. The observed rates are slightly larger than the predicted rates. The fact that the GPS uplift rates are much larger closer to Jakobshavn than further away, and are consistent with rates inferred using the ATM-based glacier thinning model, shows that GPS measurements of crustal motion are a potentially useful method for assessing ice-mass change models.},
