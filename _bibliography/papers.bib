	abstract = {Detachments of large parts of low-angle mountain glaciers in recent years have raised great attention due to their threats to lives and properties downstream. While current studies have mainly focused on post-event analysis, a few opportunities have presented themselves to assess the potential hazards of a glacier prone to detachment. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics and runout hazard of a low-angle (∼20∘) valley glacier, close to the Qinghai--Tibet railway and highway, in the East Kunlun Mountains on the Qinghai--Tibet Plateau. The changes in morphology, terminus position, and surface elevation of the glacier between 1975 and 2021 were characterized with a stereo-image pair from the historical KH-9 spy satellite, six digital elevation models (DEMs), and 11 high-resolution images from Planet Labs. The surface flow velocities of the glacier tongue between 2009 and 2020 were also tracked based on cross-correlation of Planet images. Our observations show that the glacier snout has been progressively advancing in the past 4 decades, with a stepwise increase in advance velocity from  between 1975 and 2009 to  between 2015 and 2020. DEM differencing confirms the glacial advance, with surface thinning in the source region and thickening in the tongue. The net volume loss over the glacier tongue was about  m3 during 1975--2018. Image cross-correlation reveals that the surface flow velocity of the glacier tongue has been increasing in recent years, with the mean velocity below 4800 m more than tripling from  during 2009--2010 to  during 2019--2020. With a combined analysis of the geomorphic, climatic, and hydrologic conditions of the glacier, we suggest that the flow of the glacier tongue is mainly controlled by the glacier geometry, while the presence of an ice-dammed lake and a supraglacial pond implies a hydrological influence as well. Taking the whole glacier and glacier tongue as two endmember avalanche sources, we assessed the potential runout distances of these two scenarios using the angle of reach and the Voellmy--Salm avalanche model. The assessments show that the avalanche of the whole glacier would easily travel a distance that would threaten the safety of the railway. In contrast, the detachment of the glacier tongue would threaten the railway only with a small angle of reach or when employing a low-friction parameter in the Voellmy--Salm modeling.},

	abbr = {Remote Sensing},
	abstract = {In permafrost areas, the active layer undergoes seasonal frost heave and thaw subsidence caused by ice formation and melting. The amplitude and timing of the ground displacement cycles depend on the climatic and ground conditions. Here we used Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to document the seasonal displacement progression in three regions of Svalbard. We retrieved June--November 2017 time series and identified thaw subsidence maxima and their timing. InSAR measurements were compared with a composite index model based on ground surface temperature. Cyclic seasonal patterns are identified in all areas, but the timing of the displacement progression varies. The subsidence maxima occurred later on the warm western coast (Kapp Linn{\'e} and Ny-{\AA}lesund) compared to the colder interior (Adventdalen). The composite index model is generally able to explain the observed patterns. In Adventdalen, the model matches the InSAR time series at the location of the borehole. In Kapp Linn{\'e} and Ny-{\AA}lesund, larger deviations are found at the pixel-scale, but km or regional averaging improves the fit. The study highlights the potential for further development of regional InSAR products to represent the cyclic displacements in permafrost areas and infer the active layer thermal dynamics.},

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been used to quantify a range of surface and near surface physical properties in permafrost landscapes. Most previous InSAR studies have utilized spaceborne InSAR platforms, but InSAR datasets over permafrost landscapes collected from airborne platforms have been steadily growing in recent years. Most existing algorithms dedicated toward retrieval of permafrost physical properties were originally developed for spaceborne InSAR platforms. In this study, which is the first in a two part series, we introduce a series of calibration techniques developed to apply a novel joint retrieval algorithm for permafrost active layer thickness retrieval to an airborne InSAR dataset acquired in 2017 by NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar over Alaska and Western Canada. We demonstrate how InSAR measurement uncertainties are mitigated by these calibration methods and quantify remaining measurement uncertainties with a novel method of modeling interferometric phase uncertainty using a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, we discuss the impact of native SAR resolution on InSAR measurements, the limitation of using few interferograms per retrieval, and the implications of our findings for cross-comparison of airborne and spaceborne InSAR datasets acquired over Arctic regions underlain by permafrost.},

@article{Clayton_2021,
	abbr = {ERL},
	abstract = {Active layer thickness (ALT) is a critical metric for monitoring permafrost. How soil moisture influences ALT depends on two competing hypotheses: (a) increased soil moisture increases the latent heat of fusion for thaw, resulting in shallower active layers, and (b) increased soil moisture increases soil thermal conductivity, resulting in deeper active layers. To investigate their relative influence on thaw depth, we analyzed the Field Measurements of Soil Moisture and Active Layer Thickness (SMALT) in Alaska and Canada dataset, consisting of thousands of measurements of thaw depth and soil moisture collected at dozens of sites across Alaska and Canada as part of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE). As bulk volumetric water content (VWC) integrated over the entire active layer increases, ALT decreases, supporting the latent heat hypothesis. However, as VWC in the top 12 cm of soil increases, ALT increases, supporting the thermal conductivity hypothesis. Regional temperature variations determine the baseline thaw depth while precipitation may influence the sensitivity of ALT to changes in VWC. Soil latent heat dominates over thermal conductivity in determining ALT, and the effect of bulk VWC on ALT appears consistent across sites.},

	abstract = {In the past two decades, the data volume of remote sensing imagery in the polar regions has increased dramatically. The calving fronts of many Greenland glaciers have been undergoing substantial variations, and a comprehensive front dataset is necessary for better understanding such frontal dynamics. Therefore, there is a need for an automated approach to identifying glaciological features such as calving fronts. In 2019, three deep-learning-based methods were applied to calving front delineation, but were restricted to a specific area or dataset. Here, we develop a more generalized method that can be applied to a major outlet glacier or remote sensing datasets that are not included in the training. We integrate seven remote sensing datasets into a single deep learning network. The core datasets include optical (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar images (Envisat, ALOS-1 TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2) taken over Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}, Kangerlussuaq, and Helheim, spanning from 2002 to 2019. We evaluate four neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabv3+ with ResNet, DRN, and MobileNet as the backbones) and three histogram modification strategies (e.g., histogram normalization, linear stretching, and no histogram modification). We find that the combination of histogram normalization and DRN-DeepLabv3+ has the lowest test error, at 86 m. These promising results show that our method has a high generalization ability on various glaciers and data types.},

	abstract = {Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are among the most dynamic landforms in permafrost areas, and their formation can be attributed to the thawing of ice-rich permafrost. The spatial distribution and impacts of RTSs on the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood due to their remote location and the technical challenges of automatic mapping. In this study, we innovatively applied DeepLabv3+, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm for semantic segmentation, to Planet CubeSat images, which are satellite images with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our method allows us to automatically delineate 220 RTSs within an area of 5200 km2 with an average precision of 0.541. The corresponding precision, recall, and F1 score are 0.863, 0.833, and 0.848 respectively, when the threshold of intersection over union is 0.5. Moreover, approximately 100 experiments on k-fold cross-validation (k = 3, 5, and 10) and data augmentation show that our method is robust. And a test in a different geographic area shows that the generalization of the trained model is very good. We find that (1) most of the RTSs are small (areas < eight ha and perimeters < 2000 m) and (2) RTSs preferentially develop at locations with gentle slopes (four to eight degrees), and in areas lower than the surroundings (the mean topographic position index is −0.17) and receiving less solar radiation (i.e., north-facing slopes). The results show that the method can map RTSs automatically from Planet CubeSat images and can potentially be applied to larger areas.},

	abstract = {Induced earthquakes and ground displacements were seldom reported in relation to gas injection or extraction. The Hutubi underground gas storage (HUGS) facility is the largest one in China and is also a unique case with both earthquakes and ground displacements detected during multiple cycles of injection and extraction since 9 June 2013. Unlike previous studies with a primarily seismological focus, here, we conducted quantitative analysis on the geomechanics of seismicity induced by the HUGS through developing a hydrogeologic framework, which systematically integrated geodetic, geophysical and geological data. First, we measured horizontal ground extension and shortening on the order of cm in response to gas injection and extraction of the HUGS at depth using a local GPS network, which was not reported in other regions with induced seismicity. Second, we synthesized a variety of data, including seismic reflection profiles, a newly acquired local velocity model, rock physics measurements, well drilling and logging data, to build up a 2D geomechanical model for the HUGS. Third, based on fully-coupled poroelasticity, we proposed two methods to optimize the permeability of the upper aquifers as well as the reservoir porosity and permeability with constraints from well level, GPS and well pressure data. Numerical simulations using the calibrated 2D model revealed that the horizontal extension due to the reservoir dilation is larger than ground uplift. The observed seismicity on faults without hydraulic connections to the gas repository was probably induced by the poroelastic effect of reservoir dilation. Our study provided a prototype scheme for detecting and characterizing the geomechanical behavior of cyclic fluid injection and extraction in a deep reservoir, which would be applicable to other UGS facilities.},

This will continue in the future but at an uncertain rate and observational estimates are limited to the last few decades. Understanding the long-term glacier response to external forcing is key to improving projections. Here we use historical photographs to calculate ice loss from 1880--2012 for Jakobshavn, Helheim, and Kangerlussuaq glacier. We estimate ice loss corresponding to a sea level rise of 8.1 $\pm$1.1 millimetres from these three glaciers. Projections of mass loss for these glaciers, using the worst-case scenario, Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5, suggest a sea level contribution of 9.1--14.9 mm by 2100. RCP8.5 implies an additional global temperature increase of 3.7 $\,^{\circ}$C by 2100, approximately four times larger than that which has taken place since 1880. We infer that projections forced by RCP8.5 underestimate glacier mass loss which could exceed this worst-case scenario.},

	abstract = {The irregular interannual variations observed in the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) mass balance can be interpreted as stochastic. These variations often have large amplitudes, and, if not accounted for correctly in the mass change model parameterization, could have profound impacts on the estimate of the secular trend and acceleration. Here we propose a new mass trajectory model that includes both the conventional deterministic components and a stochastic component. This new model simultaneously estimates the secular rate and acceleration, seasonal components, and the stochastic component of mass changes. Simulations show that this new model improves estimates of model parameters, especially accelerations, over the conventional model without stochastic component. Using this new model, we estimate an acceleration of −1.6 $\pm$ 1.3 Gt/yr2 in mass change (minus means mass loss) for 2003-2017 using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and an acceleration of −1.1 $\pm$ 1.3 Gt/yr2 using the modeled surface mass balance plus observed ice discharge. The corresponding rates are estimated to be −288.2 $\pm$ 12.7 Gt/yr and −274.9 $\pm$ 13.0 Gt/yr. The greatest discrepancies between the new and the conventional model parameter determinations are found in the acceleration estimates, −1.6 Gt/yr2 vs. −7.5 Gt/yr2 from the GRACE data. The estimated accelerations using the new method are apparently smaller than those estimated by other studies in terms of mass loss. Our quantitative analysis elucidates that the acceleration estimate using the conventional method is the lower bound (i.e., −7.5 Gt/yr2 for 2003--2017) while the acceleration estimated by the new method lies in the middle of the possible ranges. It is also found that these discrepancies between the new and the conventional methods diminish with sufficiently long (>20 yr) observation records.},

	abstract = {Ground surface elevation changes, soil moisture, and snow depth are all essential variables for studying the dynamics of the active layer and permafrost. GPS interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR) has been used to measure surface elevation changes and snow depth in permafrost areas. However, its applicability to estimating soil moisture in permafrost regions has not been assessed. Moreover, these variables were usually measured separately at different sites. Integrating their estimates at one site facilitates the comprehensive utilization of GPS-IR in permafrost studies. In this study, we run simulations to elucidate that the commonly used GPS-IR algorithm for estimating soil moisture content cannot be directly used in permafrost areas, because it does not consider the bias introduced by the seasonal surface elevation changes due to active layer thawing. We propose a solution to improve this default method by introducing modeled surface elevation changes. We validate this modified method using the GPS data and in situ observations at a permafrost site in the northeastern Qinghai--Tibet Plateau (QTP). The root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient between the GPS-IR estimates of soil moisture content and the in situ ones improve from 1.85 % to 1.51 % and 0.71 to 0.82, respectively. We also propose a framework to integrate the GPS-IR estimates of these three variables at one site and illustrate it using the same site in the QTP as an example. This study highlights the improvement to the default algorithm, which makes the GPS-IR valid in estimating soil moisture content in permafrost areas. The three-in-one framework is able to fully utilize the GPS-IR in permafrost areas and can be extended to other sites such as those in the Arctic. This study is also the first to use GPS-IR to estimate environmental variables in the QTP, which fills a spatial gap and provides complementary measurements to ground temperature and active layer thickness.},

	abstract = {Global Positioning System interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR) is a relatively new technique which uses reflected GPS signals to measure surface elevation changes to study frozen-ground dynamics. At present, more than 200 GPS stations are operating continuously in the Northern Hemisphere permafrost areas, which were originally designed and maintained for tectonic and ionospheric studies. However, only one site in Utqia{\.g}vik, Alaska (formerly Barrow), was assessed to be usable for studying permafrost by GPS-IR. Moreover, GPS-IR has high requirements on the ground surface condition, which needs to be open, flat, and homogeneous. In this study, we screen three major GPS networks in Canada and identify 12 out of 38 stations located in permafrost areas as useful ones where reliable GPS-IR measurements can be obtained. We focus on the five Canadian Active Control System stations and obtain their daily GPS-IR surface elevation changes. We find that the ground surface subsided in Alert, Resolute Bay, and Repulse Bay respectively by 0.61$\pm$0.04 cm yr−1 (2012--2018), 0.70$\pm$0.02 cm yr−1 (2003--2014), and 0.26$\pm$0.05 cm yr−1 (2014--2019). At the other two sites of Baker Lake and Iqaluit, the trends are not statistically significant. The linear trends of deformation were negatively correlated with those of thaw indices in Alert, Resolute Bay, and Repulse Bay. Furthermore, in Resolute Bay, we also find that the end-of-thaw elevations during 2003--2012 were highly negatively correlated with the square root of thaw indices. This study is the first one using multiple GPS stations to study permafrost by GPS-IR. It highlights the multiple useful GPS stations in northern Canada, offering multi-year, continuous, and daily GPS-IR surface deformation, which provides new insights into frozen-ground dynamics at various temporal scales and across a broad region.},

	abstract = {Understanding failure and strain localization in porous rock is of fundamental importance in rock physics. Confined compaction experiments on porous rocks have revealed a broad spectrum of failure modes. Techniques such as acoustic emission location and velocity tomography provide kinematic information on the partitioning of damage and localization of strain. Complementary observations on deformed samples using microscopy and microcomputed tomography (μCT) can also be used to image microscale damage and its distribution. Only by synthesizing such measurements on multiple scales could one infer the multiscale dynamics of compaction localization and similar rock failure phenomena. Located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, the HADES rig allows direct in situ 3D imaging of the whole rock sample as it is triaxially compressed. The μCT data provide an integrated perspective of the spatiotemporal evolution of damage and strain localization on scales ranging from grain to continuum. We conducted an experiment on Leitha limestone (initial porosity of ∼22%) at a confining pressure of 20 MPa. With increasing differential stress, the sample strain hardened and two distinct yield points were identified in the stress-strain curve. The spatiotemporal evolution of local porosity and damage were analyzed at multiple scales. At a mesoscopic scale of 10 voxels (65 μm), the time-lapse μCT images reveal the strain partitioning associated with the first yield point and development of strain localization with the second. The latter development of five discrete compaction bands is the first unambiguous observation of such a bifurcation phenomenon in a porous carbonate rock, with geometric attributes comparable to compactions bands observed in porous sandstones. The μCT data on the voxel-scale elucidate in refined details the nucleation and propagation of discrete compaction bands under quasi-static loading, as well as the micromechanical processes, which in the past could only be inferred from a synthesis of kinematic observations of acoustic emissions activity and post-mortem observations of microstructure and damage.},

	abstract = {The calving fronts of many tidewater glaciers in Greenland have been undergoing strong seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Conventionally, calving front positions have been manually delineated from remote sensing images. But manual practices can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly when processing a large number of images taken over decades and covering large areas with many glaciers, such as Greenland. Applying U-Net, a deep learning architecture, to multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images taken by the TerraSAR-X satellite, we here automatically delineate the calving front positions of Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} from 2009 to 2015. Our results are consistent with the manually delineated products generated by the Greenland Ice Sheet Climate Change Initiative project. We show that the calving fronts of Jakobshavn's two main branches retreated at mean rates of  and  m yr−1, respectively, during the years 2009 to 2015. The interannual calving front variations can be roughly divided into three phases for both branches. The retreat rates of the two branches tripled and doubled, respectively, from phase 1 (April 2009--January 2011) to phase 2 (January 2011--January 2013) and then stabilized to nearly zero in phase 3 (January 2013--December 2015). We suggest that the retreat of the calving front into an overdeepened basin whose bed is retrograde may have accelerated the retreat after 2011, while the inland--uphill bed slope behind the bottom of the overdeepened basin has prevented the glacier from retreating further after 2012. Demonstrating through this successful case study on Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} and due to the transferable nature of deep learning, our methodology can be applied to many other tidewater glaciers both in Greenland and elsewhere in the world, using multitemporal and multisensor remote sensing imagery.},

For surface vegetation, many years are required to recover to pre-fire level. In this paper, by using C-band (VV/HV polarization) and L-band (HH polarization) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired before and after fire from 2002 to 2016, we investigated vegetation change affected by the Anaktuvuk River Fire in Arctic tundra environment. Compared to the unburned areas, C- and L-band SAR backscatter coefficients increased by up to 5.5 and 4.4 dB in the severely burned areas after the fire. Then past 5 years following the fire, the C-band SAR backscatter differences decreased to pre-fire level between the burned and unburned areas, suggesting that vegetation coverage in burned sites had recovered to the unburned level. This duration is longer than the 3-year recovery suggested by optical-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) observations. While for the L-band SAR backscatter after 10-year recovery, about 2 dB higher was still found in the severely burned area, compared to the unburned area. The increased roughness of the surface is probably the reason for such sustained differences. Our analysis implies that long records of space-borne SAR backscatter can monitor post-fire vegetation recovery in Arctic tundra environment and complement optical observations.},

Applying the multichannel singular spectral analysis to the GPS-measured vertical and horizonal crustal displacement and GRACE-derived vertical displacement near Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} (JI) in western Greenland from 2007 to 2017, we reconstruct the short-term loading displacements due to ice mass changes. Both the vertical and east displacements show strong seasonal variability. They also reveal three episodes of transient displacements: downward and eastward motion from late 2007 to around 2010, sustained upward and westward motion from 2010 to early 2013, and downward and eastward motion till late 2016. We also forward model the seasonal and transient displacements caused by surface mass balance (SMB) and glacier dynamics. Our model agrees well with the geodetic observations and provides quantitative insights into the contribution from SMB and ice dynamics to the ice mass changes. We find that SMB is the dominant contributor to the seasonal and transient displacements at three out of four GPS sites (AASI, ILUL, and QEQE). While, at the fourth GPS site (KAGA) that is closest to the glacier, the contributions to the transient displacements from SMB and glacier dynamics are comparable. The forward modeling also suggests that the dynamic mass change in the JI catchment underwent strong seasonal variations and these variations correlated more with the seasonal retreat and advance of the calving front than with the changes of glacial velocities. Our altimetry results reveal that the frontal portion of JI catchment lost 34 Gt in 2012 and this loss of ice declined to only 11 Gt in 2016 due to widespread thickening along the main flowline.},

The earthquake ruptured a previously unmapped fault and was dominated by thrust slip motion of up to 95 cm within the top 3 km of the crust. Postseismic deformation analysis suggests that a combination of poroelastic rebound and afterslip are responsible for the observed signals. The inferred afterslip overlapping spatially with the coseismic rupture highlights that the postseismic slip is coupled with the pore fluid flow around the fault zones. Analysis of historic groundwater-level changes suggests that shallow seismicity around the Petermann Ranges may have been triggered by environmental stress perturbations due to the fluctuations of groundwater level; however, it is not easy to document statistical significance of this correlation.},

Comparing these results against the onsets derived from in situ measurements in Alaska, we demonstrate that this algorithm is an effective approach to detect onsets of the soil F/T transition. More specifically, our results show that the thawing onsets estimated from the SMAP data occurred 5 to 13 days earlier than the onsets estimated from the in situ measurements, which is likely due to the influence of snowmelt on the radiometer signal. The thawing onsets estimated from the ASCAT data were about 6 days later than the in situ onsets. Our estimated freezing onsets from each microwave remote sensing dataset were close to the in situ onsets (1--5 days). We also compare our estimated onsets with those from the SMAP Level 3 F/T product and the mean biases for thawing and freezing onsets are 1 $\pm$ 2 and 1 $\pm$ 3 days, respectively. Furthermore, we illustrate the complementary nature of the SMAP and ASCAT measurements and the potential for combining these two to differentiate snowmelt from soil thawing events.},

	abstract = {Much of the research to understand the ice mass changes of Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has focused on detecting linear rates and accelerations at decadal or longer periods. The transient (short-term, non-secular) mass changes show large variability, and if not properly accounted for, can introduce significant biases into estimates of long-term ice mass loss rates and accelerations. Despite the growing number of geodetic observations, in terms of spatial coverage, types of observables, and the extent of the time series, studies of the transient mass changes over GrIS are lacking. To address this limitation, we apply multi-channel singular spectral analysis to the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mass concentrations (mascon), surface mass balance (SMB) model output, and ice discharge data, to determine the transient mass changes over Greenland over the decade (2007 to 2017). The goal of this analysis is to elucidate the spatio-temporal variability of the ice mass change. For the entire GrIS, both the mascon and SMB transient mass changes are characterized by a sustained mass gain from late 2007 to early 2010, a sustained mass loss from early 2010 to early 2013, and a mass gain from early 2013 to mid-2015. Global Positioning System sites deployed along the coast of Greenland showed uplift from early 2010 to early 2013 and subsidence from early 2013 to 2015, consistent with the corresponding ice mass loss and gain of the entire GrIS. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the transient mass change was estimated to be −294 $\pm$ 27 Gt from GRACE mascons and -252 $\pm$ 16 Gt from the SMB where the latter value includes the effect of ice discharge. The transient mass change due to ice discharge accounted for less than 10% of the total transient mass change. Our regional assessment reveals that the central-west, southwest, northeast, and southeast regions display similar time-varying patterns as we found for the entire GrIS, but the north and northwest regions show different patterns. Atmospheric circulation anomalies as measured by the Greenland Blocking Index (GBI) are able to explain most of these transient anomalies. More specifically, high-GBI-associated high temperature was one of the main reasons for the transient mass loss of the entire GrIS during 2010-2012 while low GBI can explain the transient mass gain during 2013-2015. Contrasting behaviors of precipitation anomalies in east and west Greenland under abnormally high or low GBI conditions may explain the different patterns of the transient mass change in the northwest and the rest of Greenland.},

In this study, we propose a new method that combines SAR interferometry and optical images from Google Earth to map active rock glaciers (ARGs) in the northern Tien Shan (NTS) of China. We compiled an inventory that includes 261 ARGs and quantitative information about their locations, geomorphic parameters, and downslope velocities. Our inventory shows that most of the ARGs are moraine-derived (69 %) and facing northeast (56 %). The altitude distribution of ARGs in the western NTS is significantly different from those located in the eastern part. The downslope velocities of the ARGs vary significantly in space, with a maximum of about 114 cm yr−1 and a mean of about 37 cm yr−1. Using the ARG locations as a proxy for the extent of alpine permafrost, our inventory suggests that the lowest altitudinal limit for the presence of permafrost in the NTS is about 2500--2800 m, a range determined by the lowest ARG in the entire inventory and by a statistics-based estimation. The successful application of the proposed method would facilitate effective and robust efforts to map rock glaciers over mountain ranges globally.

We conducted a case study towards automatically mapping a type of thermokarst landforms (i.e., thermo-erosion gullies) in a local area in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from high-resolution images by the use of deep learning.

Validating against the field measurements and manual digitizing results, we obtained an F1 score of 0.74 (precision is 0.59 and recall is 1.0), showing that the proposed method can effectively map small and irregular thermokarst landforms. It is potentially viable to apply the designed method to mapping diverse thermokarst landforms in a larger area where high-resolution images and training data are available.},

Using this unique kind of observables, we obtain daily changes of surface elevation during July and August from 2004 to 2015. Our results show distinct temporal variations at three timescales: regular thaw settlement within each summer, strong interannual variability that is characterized by a sub-decadal subsidence trend followed by a brief uplift trend, and a secular subsidence trend of 0.26 $\pm$ 0.02 cm year−1 during 2004 and 2015.

	abstract = {Permafrost thaw subsidence, a key indicator of permafrost degradation, remains poorly quantified or understood. It is particularly challenging to detect and measure surface subsidence due to the loss of subsurface ice over a large area because it usually develops gradually, over several years or decades. Here we utilize the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSI) approach to remotely measure gradual surface subsidence on Eboling Mountain in the northeastern region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where thermal erosion gullies are well developed. Most of the previous multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar studies on permafrost used the small baseline subset method. By contrast, the PSI approach benefits from the full spatial resolution and is less affected by temporal or geometric decorrelation. In the PSI analysis, we incorporate a piecewise elevation change model that includes periodic subsidence/uplift because of its seasonally varying components as well as its linear subsidence trends. Applying this permafrost-designated PSI algorithm to 17-L band ALOS-1 PALSAR images taken between 2006 and 2011, we find that both the thermal erosion gullies and the surrounding regions (within about 300 m) subside gradually. The subsidence trends range from 0.3 to 3 cm/yr. This suggests that permafrost areas near the gullies are more vulnerable to gradual thawing and degradation. This study demonstrates the potential of using PSI to study permafrost thaw processes and of assessing its impacts over vast areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and in the Arctic.},

Herein, we demonstrate that the remotely sensed active layer thickness (ReSALT) algorithm can resolve the post-fire active layer dynamics of tundra permafrost. We generated a stack of Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar interferograms over a study region in the YK Delta spanning 2007--2010. We applied ReSALT to this stack of interferograms to measure seasonal subsidence associated with the freezing and thawing of the active layer and subsidence trends associated with wildfire. We isolated two wildfire-induced subsidence signatures, associated with the active layer and the permafrost layer. We demonstrate that InSAR is sensitive to increases in active layer thickness following wildfire, which recovers to pre-fire values after approximately 25 years. Simultaneously, we show that fire gradually thins the permafrost layer by 4 m, which recovers to pre-fire thickness after 70 years.

We measured a median STHg of 43 $\pm$ 30 ng Hg g soil−1 and a median RHgC of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.9 μg Hg g C−1, consistent with published results of STHg for tundra soils and 11,000 measurements from 4,926 temperate, nonpermafrost sites in North America and Eurasia. We estimate that the Northern Hemisphere permafrost regions contain 1,656 $\pm$ 962 Gg Hg, of which 793 $\pm$ 461 Gg Hg is frozen in permafrost. Permafrost soils store nearly twice as much Hg as all other soils, the ocean, and the atmosphere combined, and this Hg is vulnerable to release as permafrost thaws over the next century. Existing estimates greatly underestimate Hg in permafrost soils, indicating a need to reevaluate the role of the Arctic regions in the global Hg cycle.

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is currently losing ice mass. In order to accurately predict future sea level rise, the mechanisms driving the observed mass loss must be better understood. Here, we combine data from the satellite gravimetry mission Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), surface mass balance (SMB) output of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model v. 2 (RACMO2), and ice discharge estimates to analyze the mass budget of Greenland at various temporal and spatial scales. We find that the mean rate of mass variations in Greenland observed by GRACE was between −277 and −269 Gt yr−1 in 2003--2012. This estimate is consistent with the sum (i.e.,  Gt yr−1) of individual contributions -- surface mass balance (SMB, 216$\pm$122 Gt yr−1) and ice discharge (520$\pm$31 Gt yr−1) -- and with previous studies. We further identify a seasonal mass anomaly throughout the GRACE record that peaks in July at 80--120 Gt and which we interpret to be due to a combination of englacial and subglacial water storage generated by summer surface melting. The robustness of this estimate is demonstrated by using both different GRACE-based solutions and different meltwater runoff estimates (namely, RACMO2.3, SNOWPACK, and MAR3.9). Meltwater storage in the ice sheet occurs primarily due to storage in the high-accumulation regions of the southeast and northwest parts of Greenland. Analysis of seasonal variations in outlet glacier discharge shows that the contribution of ice discharge to the observed signal is minor (at the level of only a few gigatonnes) and does not explain the seasonal differences between the total mass and SMB signals. With the improved quantification of meltwater storage at the seasonal scale, we highlight its importance for understanding glacio-hydrological processes and their contributions to the ice sheet mass variability.},

The consequences of permafrost degradation associated with thermokarst for surface ecology, landscape evolution, and hydrological processes have been of great scientific interest and social concern. Part of a tundra patch affected by wildfire in northern Alaska (27.5 km(2)) was investigated here, using remote sensing and in situ surveys to quantify and understand permafrost thaw dynamics after surface disturbances. A two-pass differential InSAR technique using L-band ALOS-PALSAR has been shown capable of capturing thermokarst subsidence triggered by a tundra fire at a spatial resolution of tens of meters, with supporting evidence from field data and optical satellite images. We have introduced a calibration procedure, comparing burned and unburned areas for InSAR subsidence signals, to remove the noise due to seasonal surface movement. In the first year after the fire, an average subsidence rate of 6.2 cm/year (vertical) was measured. Subsidence in the burned area continued over the following two years, with decreased rates. The mean rate of subsidence observed in our interferograms (from 24 July 2008 to 14 September 2010) was 3.3 cm/year, a value comparable to that estimated from field surveys at two plots on average (2.2 cm/year) for the six years after the fire. These results suggest that this InSAR-measured ground subsidence is caused by the development of thermokarst, a thawing process supported by surface change observations from high-resolution optical images and in situ ground level surveys.},

In addition to the secular uplift trends, the GPS time series also show prominent annual variability. Here we examine the annual changes of the vertical displacements measured at two GPS stations (SRMP and UPVK) near Upernavik Isstr{\o}m in western Greenland. We model elastic loading displacements due to various surface mass loading including three nonice components: atmospheric pressure, ocean bottom pressure, continental water storage, and one ice component, i.e., surface mass balance (SMB). We find that the contribution from atmospheric pressure changes can explain 46% and 78% of the annual amplitude observed in the GPS verticals at SRMP and UPVK, respectively. We also show that removing the predicted loading displacements due to SMB adversely increases the annual variance of the GPS residuals. However, using the GPS data alone, we cannot identify the exact cause(s) of this discrepancy because the annual loading displacements are sensitive to the SMB changes from over 85% of the ice sheet area. Alternatively, by differencing vertical displacements between the two stations, we find a good agreement between the modeled differential SMB loading displacements and the GPS residuals after removing nonice components. Our study highlights the necessity of correcting for nonice loading contributions in the GPS measurements of crustal deformation to infer ice mass changes in Greenland at annual periods.},

Using the GPS and GRACE data near Upernavik Isstr{\o}m in West Greenland as an example, we demonstrate that this method successfully detects two transient signals in ice mass variations during 2008 and 2014. Our forward modeling of loading displacements due to changes in surface mass balance (SMB) and ice dynamics suggests that the transient change starting in mid-2008 was due to the combined contributions from dynamically induced mass loss and SMB. The transient change starting in mid-2011 was mainly due to ablation. Specifically, the ice melted more in 2012 and less in 2013 with little contribution from anomalies in accumulation.},

Using a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system in a common-offset configuration, we measured the two-way traveltimes from the surface to the bottom of the active layer at the end of summer, when the thaw depth was greatest. We used 500 and 800 MHz antennas; the 500 MHz antenna provided suitable vertical resolution, while producing more unambiguous active-layer reflections in the presence of nonideal antenna coupling and active layer inhomogeneity. We derived ALT measurements and their uncertainties from GPR two-way traveltimes, with mechanical probing for velocity calibration. Using an empirical relationship between the wave velocity and soil volumetric water content (VWC), we found that the velocities were consistent with soil VWCs ranging from 0.46 to 0.63. In 31% of traces, the permafrost table horizon was identifiable, resulting in ALT measurements with uncertainties of generally less than 25%. The average ALT was 48.1 cm, with a standard deviation of 16.1 cm. We found distinct patterns of ALT spatial variability at different sites and different length scales. At some sites, the ALT at one point was effectively uncorrelated with ALT at other points separated by lag distances as small as tens of meters; for other sites, there was correlation at lag distances up to approximately 400 m. The ALT statistics were similar to nearby long-term in situ ALT measurements from the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring Network, through which yearly ALT measurements have been made since 1990.},

	abstract = {In permafrost terrains, the frozen-unfrozen boundary, located at the base of the active layer, is a prominent ground-penetrating radar (GPR) target and is typically used to retrieve active layer thickness. Less attention has been given to the capability of the GPR in detecting structures within the active layer. In this paper, using 500 MHz GPR data from a thermokarst site in the Arctic Coastal Plain, we demonstrate that GPR can retrieve, when present, the internal stratigraphy of the thawed layer. We recognized two types of thermokarst-related microtopographic units: dry-and-uniform peaty hummocks with a thin (∼30 cm) active layer and inter-hummock depressions with a thicker (∼60 cm) active layer characterized by two different layers---a surface peat layer on top of silt confirmed by test pits. Radar wave velocity analysis, done with a common-midpoint survey, suggests a contrast in volumetric water content (87% and 45% for the upper and lower layers, respectively). The subsurface radar wave velocity suggests that the porous peat layer contains more water (87% by volume) than the underlying silt layer (45% by volume), resulting in a strong dielectric contrast and a strong radar reflection. This study demonstrates the usefulness of GPR to measure the thickness and properties of the surface organic layer in permafrost regions.},

	abstract = {Fire-induced permafrost degradation is well documented in boreal forests, but the role of fires in initiating thermokarst development in Arctic tundra is less well understood. Here we show that Arctic tundra fires may induce widespread thaw subsidence of permafrost terrain in the first seven years following the disturbance. Quantitative analysis of airborne LiDAR data acquired two and seven years post-fire, detected permafrost thaw subsidence across 34% of the burned tundra area studied, compared to less than 1% in similar undisturbed, ice-rich tundra terrain units. The variability in thermokarst development appears to be influenced by the interaction of tundra fire burn severity and near-surface, ground-ice content. Subsidence was greatest in severely burned, ice-rich upland terrain (yedoma), accounting for ~50% of the detected subsidence, despite representing only 30% of the fire disturbed study area. Microtopography increased by 340% in this terrain unit as a result of ice wedge degradation. Increases in the frequency, magnitude and severity of tundra fires will contribute to future thermokarst development and associated landscape change in Arctic tundra regions.},

	abstract = {Thawing of ice-rich permafrost followed by surface subsidence results in irregular, depressed landforms known as thermokarst. Many remote sensing studies have identified thermokarst landforms and mapped their changes. However, the intrinsic dynamic thermokarst process of surface subsidence remains a challenge to quantify and is seldom examined using remote sensing methods. In this study we used spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to map surface subsidence trends at a thermokarst landform located near Deadhorse on the North Slope of Alaska. A pipeline access road constructed in the 1970s triggered the thawing of the permafrost, causing subsequent expansion of the thermokarst landform. Using Phased Array type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar images acquired by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1, our InSAR analysis reveals localized thermokarst subsidence of 2--8 cm/yr between 2006 and 2010, equivalent to an ice volume loss of about 1.2 × 107 m3/yr. Comparisons between InSAR subsidence trends and lidar microtopography suggest a characteristic time of 8 years of thermokarst development. We also quantitatively explain the difficulty, uncertainties, and possible biases in separating thermokarst-induced, irreversible subsidence from cyclic seasonal deformation. Our study illustrates that InSAR is an effective tool for mapping and studying active thermokarst processes and quantifying ice loss.

ReSALT accurately reproduced observed ALT within uncertainty of the GPR and probing data in ~76% of the study area. However, ReSALT was less than observed ALT in ~22% of the study area with well-drained soils and in ~1% of the area where soils contained gravel.

Improving our understanding of carbon dynamics in thawing permafrost requires more data on carbon and nitrogen content, soil physical and chemical properties and substrate quality in cryosols. We analyzed five permafrost cores obtained from the North Slope of Alaska during the summer of 2009. The relationship between SOC and soil bulk density can be adequately represented by a logarithmic function. Gas fluxes at − 5 $\,^{\circ}$C and 5 $\,^{\circ}$C were measured to calculate the temperature response quotient (Q10). Q10 and the respiration per unit soil C were higher in permafrost-affected soils than that in the active layer, suggesting that decomposition and heterotrophic respiration in cryosols may contribute more to global warming.},

We detected an increase of up to 8 cm of thaw-season ground subsidence after the fire, which is due to a combination of thickened active layer and permafrost thaw subsidence. Our results illustrate the effectiveness and potential of using InSAR to quantify fire impacts on the Arctic tundra, especially in regions underlain by ice-rich permafrost.

	abstract = {Drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs) are ubiquitous landforms on Arctic tundra lowland. Their dynamic states are seldom investigated, despite their importance for landscape stability, hydrology, nutrient fluxes, and carbon cycling. Here we report results based on high-resolution Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements using space-borne data for a study area located on the North Slope of Alaska near Prudhoe Bay, where we focus on the seasonal thaw settlement within DTLBs, averaged between 2006 and 2010. The majority (14) of the 18 DTLBs in the study area exhibited seasonal thaw settlement of 3--4 cm. However, four of the DTLBs examined exceeded 4 cm of thaw settlement, with one basin experiencing up to 12 cm. Combining the InSAR observations with the in situ active layer thickness measured using ground penetrating radar and mechanical probing, we calculated thaw strain, an index of thaw settlement strength along a transect across the basin that underwent large thaw settlement. We found thaw strains of 10--35% at the basin center, suggesting the seasonal melting of ground ice as a possible mechanism for the large settlement. These findings emphasize the dynamic nature of permafrost landforms, demonstrate the capability of the InSAR technique to remotely monitor surface deformation of individual DTLBs, and illustrate the combination of ground-based and remote sensing observations to estimate thaw strain. Our study highlights the need for better description of the spatial heterogeneity of landscape-scale processes for regional assessment of surface dynamics on Arctic coastal lowlands.

A significant portion of this contribution is associated with the speed-up of an increased number of glaciers in southeast and northwest Greenland. Here, we show that the northeast Greenland ice stream, which extends more than 600 km into the interior of the ice sheet, is now undergoing sustained dynamic thinning, linked to regional warming, after more than a quarter of a century of stability. This sector of the Greenland ice sheet is of particular interest, because the drainage basin area covers 16% of the ice sheet (twice that of Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}) and numerical model predictions suggest no significant mass loss for this sector, leading to an under-estimation of future global sea-level rise.

We illustrate this method by applying it to two specific cases: an analysis of GPS data from northern California to monitor the level of Lake Shasta, and the analysis of data from a single GPS site in southeast Greenland to determine mass variability of two large, nearby outlet glaciers: Helheim Glacier and Midgaard Glacier. The California example serves largely as a proof-of-concept, where the results can be assessed by comparing with independent observations (Lake Shasta tide gauge data, in this case). Our Greenland results show that both Helheim and Midgaard have experienced notable interannual variations in mass loss rate over the last decade.

	abstract = {Ground-based measurements of active layer thickness provide useful data for validating/calibrating remote sensing and modeling results. However, these in situ measurements are usually site-specific with limited spatial coverage. Here we apply interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to measure surface deformation over permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska during the 1992-2000 thawing seasons. We find significantly systematic differences in surface deformation between floodplain areas and the tundra-covered areas away from the rivers. Using floodplain areas as the reference for InSAR's relative deformation measurements, we find seasonally varying vertical displacements of 1-4 cm with subsidence occurring during the thawing season and a secular subsidence of 1-4 cm/decade. We hypothesize that the seasonal subsidence is caused by thaw settlement of the active layer and that the secular subsidence is probably due to thawing of ice-rich permafrost near the permafrost table. These mechanisms could explain why in situ measurements on Alaskan North Slope reveal negligible trends in active layer thickness during the 1990s, despite the fact that atmospheric and permafrost temperatures in this region increased during that time. This study demonstrates that surface deformation measurements from InSAR are complementary to more traditional in situ measurements of active layer thickness, and can provide new insights into the dynamics of permafrost systems and changes in permafrost conditions.},

	abstract = {Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} in west Greenland has been undergoing dramatic thinning since 1997. Applying the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to Radarsat-1 SAR data, we measure crustal uplift near Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} caused by recent ice mass loss. The crustal uplift is predominantly at long spatial wavelengths (larger than 10 km), and thus is difficult to separate from InSAR orbit errors. We reduce the effects of orbit errors by removing long-wavelength deformation signals using conventional InSAR baseline fitting methods. We find good agreement between the remaining short-scale InSAR-estimated deformation rates during 2004-2008 and the corresponding short-scale components of a deformation model that is based on changes in ice elevation measured by NASA′s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). We are also able to use the InSAR-measured deformation to invert for the spatial pattern of ice thinning. Overall, our results suggest that despite the inherent difficulties of working with a signal that has significant large-scale components, InSAR-measured crustal deformation can be used to study the ice mass loss of a rapidly thinning glacier and its surrounding catchment, providing both a constraint on any existing model of ice mass loss and a data source that can be used to invert for ice mass loss. These new applications of InSAR can help to better understand a glacier′s rapid response to a warming climate.},

	abbr = {JGR Solid Earth},
	abstract = {We analyze 2006--2009 data from four continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers located between 5 and 150 km from the glacier Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}, West Greenland. The GPS stations were established on bedrock to determine the vertical crustal motion due to the unloading of ice from Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}. All stations experienced uplift, but the uplift rate at Kangia North, only 5 km from the glacier front, was about 10 mm yr−1 larger than the rate at Ilulissat, located only ∼45 km further away. This suggests that most of the uplift is due to the unloading of the Earth's surface as Jakobshavn thins and loses mass. Our estimate of Jakobshavn's contribution to uplift rates at Kangia North and Ilulissat are 14.6 $\pm$ 1.7 mm yr−1 and 4.9 $\pm$ 1.1 mm yr−1, respectively. The observed rates are consistent with a glacier thinning model based on repeat altimeter surveys from NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), which shows that Jakobshavn lost mass at an average rate of 22 $\pm$ 2 km3 yr−1 between 2006 and 2009. At Kangia North and Ilulissat, the predicted uplift rates computed using thinning estimates from the ATM laser altimetry are 12.1 $\pm$ 0.9 mm yr−1 and 3.2 $\pm$ 0.3 mm yr−1, respectively. The observed rates are slightly larger than the predicted rates. The fact that the GPS uplift rates are much larger closer to Jakobshavn than further away, and are consistent with rates inferred using the ATM-based glacier thinning model, shows that GPS measurements of crustal motion are a potentially useful method for assessing ice-mass change models.},
