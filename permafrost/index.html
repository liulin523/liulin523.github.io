Her research is based on remote sensing especially InSAR technique and in-situ geological and geophysical investigations.</p> <p>Watch this 1-min video to get a glimpse of her recent work:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xL42_UPkvI0?rel=0&amp;start=5" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>Yan also presented this work at the 5th European Conference on Permafrost (see her <a href="https://liulin523.github.io/assets/EUCOP5_poster_YanHU.pdf">poster</a>).</p> <p>Our collaborators include Professors Lin Zhao and Tonghua Wu (Chinese Academy of Sciences), Professor Tobias Bolch and Dr. Philipp Rastern (University of Zurich), and Dr. Xiaowen Wang (University of Tokyo).</p> <p>This research is funded by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Project CUHK14303417).</p> <p>Yan is supported by the <a href="http://www.rgc.edu.hk/hkphd" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme</a>.</p> <p>   </p> <h2 id="thermokarst-landforms-on-the-tibetan-plateau">Thermokarst landforms on the Tibetan Plateau</h2> <p>Summer Xia (PhD student) and Lingcao Huang (former postdoc)</p> <p>This research focuses on the distribution of thermokarst landforms, including thaw slumps (the figure below) and thermal erosion gullies, on the Tibetan Plateau and the factors affecting them. In many permafrost areas, warming and thawing of ground result in distinct thermokarst landforms in remote and isolated regions. He applies image processing methods, including deep learning algorithm, to multi-source remote sensing data, aiming to map these landforms automatically. Wealso analyze the spatial-temporal changes of the mapped landforms and investigates the driving factors of their evolution by integrating other data such as digital elevation model and meteorological data.</p> <p><img src="https://liulin523.github.io/images/research/lingcao_thermokarst.png" alt="" style="width: 800px"></p> <p><em>Left: Ground photo of a thaw slump in Beiluhe, Tibet; Right: Planet CubeSat image © 2018 Planet Labs Inc.

H<sub>Ant</sub> and H<sub>surf</sub> represent the height of the antenna and reflecting surface respectively. H<sub>R</sub>, the vertical distance between H<sub>Ant</sub> and H<sub>surf</sub>, is one of the key observables of GNSS-IR. Decrease (increase) of H<sub>R</sub> indicates the uplift (subsidence) of the reflecting surface. Right: The conceptual model of the seasonal vertical deformation (subsidence in summer and uplift in winter) of the ground surface in permafrost terrain. Such vertical deformation is mainly caused by the phase change of soil moisture within the active layer.
