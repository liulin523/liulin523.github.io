Our new paper published in <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2025.02.019' > ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</a> systematically assesses time series models for InSAR permafrost studies and proposes a novel strategy for selecting reference points. Congratulations to Chengyan!
