## Terminus variations of Greenland glaciers

Enze Zhang, PhD Thesis Project

Enze’s research focuses on terminus variations of glaciers in Greenland, quantifying such variations in a high temporal resolution and understanding their controlling factors. Based on deep learning, he develops a method to extract the calving front automatically using multi-sensor remote sensing imagery (TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, Landsat). He also analyzes the controlling factors of the calving front variations by combining other data such as glacier velocity and bed elevation. His work has been published in several papers ({% cite Zhang_2021%}).

## Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance

Jiangjun (JJ) Ran, Postdoc

Jiangjun is currently investigating the Greenland ice sheet mass balance using the regional climate models (e.g., RACMO 2.3 and MAR 3.9), and data from remote sensing technologies (e.g., satellite gravimetry, InSAR, and altimetry). More specifically, he is interested in deriving the mass variations of the Greenland ice sheet from GRACE in a statistically optimal way using the “mascon” (i.e., mass concentration) approach. Furthermore, he is also trying to understand the mass anomalies in the sub-surface processes of Greenland ice sheet (e.g., meltwater retention) at short-time scales.
