Our research group studies the cryosphere, namely the earthâ€™s surface where water is frozen. We use a wide range of methods, including geophysics, geodesy, remote sensing, and deep learning. We adopt new tools, develop new algorithms, make new observations to quantify the dynamics of the cryospheric systems. 

You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
