Our research group investigates the cryosphere—the Earth's surface where water exists in frozen form.
We integrates a diverse suite of methods, including geophysics, geodesy, remote sensing, and deep learning, to explore the dynamics of cryospheric systems. By adopting cutting-edge tools, developing novel algorithms, and generating new observations, we seek to better understand cryospheric processes, assess the impacts of a warming climate, and quantify the cryosphere’s interactions with the atmosphere, biosphere, ocean, and solid Earth.

**We are recruiting new PhD students** [(see opportunities)](/opportunties/)!
